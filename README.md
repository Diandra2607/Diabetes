# Background
The Diabetes Dataset is a dataset used by researchers to employ statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms to uncover Diabetes patterns in patients. The scikit-learn Diabetes Dataset or Sklearn Diabetes dataset consists of ten baseline variables, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, obtained for 442 diabetes patients. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. In this project, the K-Means Clustering method will be used. 

# Preprocessing
The first step is to do a data preprocessing. First, import the data. After that, check the data, if there is missing values on it. Based on the data preprocessing, there are no missing values on the data
